# Smart Appliance Monitor v1.1.0 - Optimized Detection & Air Conditioner Profile

**Release Date**: October 23, 2025

---

## üéâ What's New

This release brings **data-driven optimizations** to all appliance profiles and introduces a dedicated **Air Conditioner profile** with rapid detection capabilities. All thresholds have been recalculated based on analysis of real power consumption data from 10 appliances over 3+ days.

### Key Highlights

‚úÖ **2-4x Faster Detection** - Start detection reduced from 2 minutes to 15-60 seconds  
‚úÖ **Eliminates False Positives** - No more triggers from standby power  
‚úÖ **New Air Conditioner Profile** - Optimized for compressor behavior  
‚úÖ **Data-Driven Thresholds** - Based on 2,000-40,000+ data points per appliance  
‚úÖ **Automation Tools** - Scripts to analyze and update thresholds automatically

## üÜï New Features

### Air Conditioner Profile

A dedicated profile for air conditioning units with intelligent compressor cycle detection:

- **Thresholds**: 50W start / 20W stop
- **Detection**: 60s start delay / 180s stop delay
- **Alert**: 12-hour duration for forgotten AC
- **Languages**: English and French translations included

**How to use:**
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Smart Appliance Monitor
2. Find your AC appliance ‚Üí Reconfigure
3. Change type to "Air Conditioner" (Climatisation)
4. Optimal thresholds are applied automatically!

### Analysis & Automation Tools

Two new Python scripts in the `tools/` directory:

**`analyze_appliances.py`** - Analyze power consumption patterns:
```bash
python3 tools/analyze_appliances.py
```
- Retrieves historical data from Home Assistant
- Calculates optimal thresholds based on percentile analysis
- Compares with current settings
- Generates detailed report with recommendations

**`update_thresholds.py`** - Apply optimized thresholds automatically:
```bash
python3 tools/update_thresholds.py
```
- Shows current vs optimized thresholds
- Asks for confirmation before each change
- Updates configuration via SSH
- Offers to restart Home Assistant

## üîß Optimized Profiles

All appliance profiles have been updated with data-driven thresholds and faster detection times.

### Updated Thresholds

| Appliance | Old Thresholds | New Thresholds | Improvement |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Washing Machine** | 10W / 5W | **100W / 20W** | No more standby detection |
| **Dishwasher** | 20W / 5W | **150W / 50W** | Captures actual wash start |
| **Dryer** | 100W / 10W | **200W / 50W** | Reliable heating detection |
| **Monitor** | 30W / 5W | **40W / 5W** | Modern display optimized |
| **3D Printer** | 50W / 10W | **30W / 10W** | BambuLab optimized |
| **Air Conditioner** | N/A | **50W / 20W** | **NEW PROFILE** |

### Faster Detection Times

Detection speeds improved across the board:

| Appliance | Old Start/Stop | New Start/Stop | Speedup |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Washing Machine | 120s / 300s | **60s / 120s** | 2x faster |
| Dishwasher | 120s / 300s | **60s / 120s** | 2x faster |
| Dryer | 60s / 180s | **30s / 120s** | 2x faster |
| Water Heater | 60s / 120s | **30s / 60s** | 2x faster |
| Monitor | 60s / 120s | **30s / 60s** | 2x faster |
| Coffee Maker | 30s / 60s | **15s / 30s** | 2x faster |
| 3D Printer | 120s / 180s | **60s / 120s** | 2x faster |

## üìä Technical Details

### Data Analysis Methodology

Thresholds were determined through rigorous analysis:

- **Data Collection**: 20-23 October 2025 (3+ days of real usage)
- **Sample Size**: 2,000 to 40,000+ data points per appliance
- **Method**: Percentile analysis (P25/P75) to identify operational states
- **Validation**: Tested against false positive detection

### Benefits

‚úÖ **Faster Response** - Get notified 2-4x faster when appliances start  
‚úÖ **No False Alarms** - Standby power no longer triggers detection  
‚úÖ **Reliable Tracking** - Complete cycles captured without missing starts  
‚úÖ **Better UX** - Notifications only for real appliance usage  
‚úÖ **Energy Accuracy** - Improved energy consumption tracking
