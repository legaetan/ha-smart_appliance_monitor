# Smart Appliance Monitor v0.5.4 - API Compatibility Fix

## üêõ Critical Bug Fix

- **Error resolved**: `AttributeError: 'HomeAssistantHTTP' object has no attribute 'register_static_path'`
- **Cards now properly registered** at `/hacsfiles/smart-appliance-cards/`
- **Integration loads successfully** without errors

### Technical Changes
