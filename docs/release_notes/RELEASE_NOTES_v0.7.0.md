- **Monthly Savings Potential**: Estimated savings if recommendations are followed

### New Services

1. **`configure_ai`** - Set up AI analysis for all appliances
2. **`analyze_cycles`** - Analyze individual appliance usage
3. **`analyze_energy_dashboard`** - Analyze global home consumption

### New Entities

- **AI Analysis Switch** (`switch.<appliance>_ai_analysis`) - Enable/disable analysis per appliance
- **Energy Dashboard AI Sensor** (`sensor.sam_energy_dashboard_ai_analysis`) - Global efficiency score

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Home Assistant AI Integration**: Configure an AI Task entity
   - OpenAI Conversation
   - Anthropic Claude
   - Google Generative AI
   - Ollama (local)
   - Or any other HA-compatible AI provider

2. **Cycle History**: Enable anomaly detection on your appliances to build cycle history (5-10 cycles recommended)

### Quick Setup

1. **Configure AI Task**:
   ```yaml
   service: smart_appliance_monitor.configure_ai
   data:
     ai_task_entity: ai_task.openai_ai_task
     enable_ai_analysis: true
     ai_analysis_trigger: manual  # or auto_cycle_end
   ```

2. **Analyze an Appliance**:
   ```yaml
   service: smart_appliance_monitor.analyze_cycles
   data:
     entity_id: sensor.washing_machine_state
     analysis_type: all
     cycle_count: 10
   ```

3. **Check Results**: View `sensor.washing_machine_ai_analysis` for insights and recommendations

### Detailed Testing Guide

See [TESTING_AI.md](../TESTING_AI.md) for comprehensive setup instructions and test scenarios.

## üìñ Example Use Cases

### Cost Savings
**Scenario**: You want to reduce your electricity bill.

**Solution**: Run AI analysis to identify:
- Peak usage hours when electricity is most expensive
- Recommended off-peak hours for running appliances
- Estimated monthly savings by shifting usage

**Example Output**:
```
Status: needs_improvement
Recommendations:
  - Shift washing machine usage to 22:00-06:00 for off-peak rates
  - Reduce average cycle duration by using eco mode
  - Schedule dishwasher during weekend off-peak hours
Potential Savings: 2.5 kWh/month (‚Ç¨0.63/month)
```

### Maintenance Alerts
**Scenario**: Detect when appliances might need maintenance.

**Solution**: Comparative analysis identifies unusual patterns:
- Increasing energy consumption over time
- Longer cycle durations than normal
- Unusual power spikes

**Example Output**:
```
Status: normal
Insights:
  - Average consumption increased by 15% over last month
  - This may indicate need for maintenance or cleaning
  - Consider descaling or filter cleaning
```

### Usage Optimization
**Scenario**: Optimize household energy consumption.

**Solution**: Global dashboard analysis provides:
- Home-wide efficiency score
- Top energy consumers
- Specific optimization recommendations per appliance

**Example Output**:
```
Efficiency Score: 72/100
Top Consumers:
  1. Water Heater (45% of consumption)
  2. Washing Machine (23%)
  3. Dryer (18%)
Recommendations:
  - Lower water heater temperature to 55¬∞C
  - Use cold water cycles for washing machine
  - Consider air-drying instead of using dryer
Estimated Monthly Savings: ‚Ç¨12.50
```

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

### Cloud AI Providers (OpenAI, Claude)
- **Per-cycle analysis**: ~$0.01-0.03
- **Dashboard analysis**: ~$0.02-0.05
- **Monthly estimate** (10 appliances, weekly analysis): ~$2-5

### Local AI (Ollama)
- **Cost**: Free (hardware only)
- **Faster responses**: 5-15 seconds vs 10-30 seconds
- **Privacy**: All data stays local
- **Recommendation**: Use Llama 2, Mistral, or similar

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Best Results

1. **Build History First**: Wait for 5-10 cycles before analyzing
2. **Enable Anomaly Detection**: Ensures cycle history is tracked
3. **Start Manual**: Test with `manual` trigger before enabling `auto_cycle_end`
4. **Review Regularly**: Weekly or monthly analysis provides best insights
5. **Act on Recommendations**: Implement suggestions and re-analyze to measure improvement

### Automation Examples

**Daily Dashboard Analysis**:
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Daily Energy Analysis"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "23:00:00"
