# Smart Appliance Monitor v0.9.2 - Bug Fixes & Code Quality

**Release Date**: January 23, 2025  
**Type**: Bug Fix Release  
**Download**: [smart_appliance_monitor-v0.9.2.zip](https://github.com/legaetan/ha-smart_appliance_monitor/releases/tag/v0.9.2)

## Overview

This release fixes critical bugs affecting notification persistence and the Energy Dashboard sync service, while also improving code quality by properly implementing the Home Assistant translation system.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Notification Persistence Fixed

**Problem**: Notification switch states (cycle_started, cycle_finished, alert_duration, unplugged) were not saved and were reset to default values after Home Assistant restart.

**Solution**: 
- Added `notification_type_switches` dictionary to the state persistence system in `coordinator.py`
- Notification switches now trigger state save when toggled
- States are properly restored from `.storage/smart_appliance_monitor.{entry_id}` on restart

**Impact**: Your notification preferences will now be preserved across Home Assistant restarts.

### Energy Dashboard Sync Service Error Fixed

**Problem**: The `sync_with_energy_dashboard` service failed with error: "property 'price_kwh' of 'SmartApplianceCoordinator' object has no setter"

**Solution**:
- Updated the service to use the `GlobalConfigManager` for price management (introduced in v0.9.0)
- Removed direct assignments to the read-only `price_kwh` property
- Service now properly updates global price configuration for all appliances

**Impact**: The Energy Dashboard sync service now works correctly and updates global pricing without errors.

## üîß Code Quality Improvements

### Entity Name Translation System

**What Changed**: Removed 33 hardcoded French entity names (`_attr_name`) and implemented proper Home Assistant translation system.

**Technical Details**:
- Removed `_attr_name` assignments in:
  - `sensor.py`: 15 sensors
  - `binary_sensor.py`: 7 binary sensors
  - `switch.py`: 10 switches
  - `button.py`: 1 button
- Entity IDs remain in English (e.g., `sensor.clim_cycle_cost`)
- Display names are now translated automatically via `_attr_translation_key` system
- Uses `translations/fr.json` for French, `strings.json` for English

**Impact for Users**:
- ‚úÖ **Existing installations**: No impact - entity IDs are preserved in entity registry
- ‚úÖ **New installations**: Cleaner entity ID generation from the start
- ‚úÖ **Developers**: Better code maintainability and follows Home Assistant best practices
